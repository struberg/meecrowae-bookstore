# Example Bookstore or Apache Meecrowave

This project contains a small example to highlight some basic Apache Meecrowave features.

## What is Apache Meecrowave?

Apache Meecrowave is a small server based on JavaEE8 technologies:

* CDI-2.0 (Apache OpenWebBeans-2.0.x)
* Servlet-4.0 (Apache Tomcat-9.0.x)
* JSON_P-1.1 and JSON_B-1.0 (Apache Johnzon
* JAX-RS-2.1 (Apache CXF-3.2.x)
* log4j 2.x

## Running the sample

Using the meecrowave-maven-plugin we can run the server from the commandline with the following command

```
$> mvn clean install meecrowave:run
```

For debugging we can use:
```
$> mvnDebug meecrowave:run
```

If you want to bundle the project together into a deployable bundle just use
```
$> mvn meecrowave:bundle
```
You will end up with a zip file in ./target/.
This zip will contain all the libraries of the whole container plus your own code parts and resources.
